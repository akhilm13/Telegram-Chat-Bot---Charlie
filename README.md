# Telegram-Chat-Bot---Charlie
This is the source code for a chat bot for Telegram Messenger programmed in C# using the Telegram Bot API and AIML.

**Note** that this is only the **source code** of the bot. This is __not the working version__. 

In order to use this code, you have to first procure a Bot API key from the Telegram Bot called BotFather (or refer Telegram Bot Documentation https://core.telegram.org/bots)
Insert the API key in the main function (where it is indicated).

Then, make required customizations and modifications to the AIML template files in the Debug folder of the Charlie Library (like the name of the botmaster and name of the bot etc in the Settings file in the config folder). 

The bot should now be ready to talk.
